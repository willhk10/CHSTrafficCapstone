# TrafficControl
2022-2023 Capstone Engineering Project. 

## Table of Contents
* [Scheduled work](#documentation)
* [Code](#Code)



### Task:
Use cumulative knowledge to solve an important issue.



# Planning
<ln>
  
## Outline of project
*  Research the traffic patterns and issues around Charlottesville High School.
    * Use various data collection methods
      * drone footage
      * road-bump sensors
      * school climate surverys
    * Use data to create accurate traffic simulation
    * Use simulation to investigate possible solutions


## Materials
* Project is  simulation and computer-driven.
  * Visual Studio Code
  * Github
  * Python
* Must have a mechatronics aspect
  * Pressure plates on road detecting cars coming in and out
  * Possibly have car-detection software running on drone cameras


## Risk Mitigation
* Our project is pretty low risk
* Keeping drone at safe height, no higher than 120m
* No lower than 60m

# To-Do
* Gather data in morning and afternoon
  * Use drone to collect data
  * 
## Tentative schedule
* Yes

# Climate Survey results
* Yes



# Code
* Yes



# Traffic simulation plan
* Yes

### Week 6: 9/25/22
* Looked at last Friday's afternoon traffic video, tried to apply computer vision, but ran in to some problems. Also, this video starts at 3:59, which is after many people have been dismissed and already left the building
* Took drone video of morning traffic flow
* One issue that we are running in to is deciding which simulation software to use and learning how to use it. The programs that we have found so far have either not had the right traffic tools (Anylogic) or been very opaque and hard to learn (SUMO)
* Currently researching VISSIM, which could be a better balance of ease of use and applicability
