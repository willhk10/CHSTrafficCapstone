# TrafficControl
2022-2023 Capstone Engineering Project. 

### Task:
Use cumulative knowledge to solve an important issue.



# Planning
<ln>
  
## Initial ideas:
*  Research the traffic patterns and issues around Charlottesville High School.
    * Use various data collection methods
      * drone footage
      * road-bump sensors
      * school climate surverys
    * Use data to create accurate traffic simulation
    * Use simulation to investigate possible solutions


## Materials
* Project is  simulation and computer-driven.
  * Visual Studio Code
  * Github
  * Python
* Must have a mechatronics aspect
  * Pressure plates on road detecting cars coming in and out
  * Possibly have car-detection software running on drone cameras


## Risk Mitigation
* Our project is pretty low risk
* Keeping drone at safe height, no higher than 120m
* No lower than 60m

# To-Do
* Gather data in morning and afternoon
  *
